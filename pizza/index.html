    <h2>Shrimp Pizza Description</h2>
    <p>
      This is a great summertime pizza, because it is light and it can be served
      hot or cold.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened</li>
      <li>1 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>Â½ cup mayonnaise</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Stir together the
        cream cheese, Parmesan cheese, mayonnaise, garlic, and spinach until
        evenly mixed; set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Press the pizza dough onto a baking sheet, and brush with 2 tablespoons
        of olive oil. Sprinkle with 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning. Bake in the
        preheated oven until golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a skillet over medium
        heat, and cook the bell pepper and onion until tender, about 5 minutes.
        Season with 2 teaspoons of Italian seasoning, and stir in the canned
        shrimp; cook until the shrimp are heated through.
      </li>
      <li>
        When the crust has baked, remove from the oven, and spread evenly with
        the spinach mixture. Spread the shrimp and vegetable mixture onto the
        pizza, and cut into pieces to serve.
      </li>
    </ol>
